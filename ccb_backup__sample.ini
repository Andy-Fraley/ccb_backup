# The ccb_backup.py utility creates a ZIP file with retrieved CSVs for all individuals, groups + members,
# events + attendance, pledges, and transactions (contributions).  Because these CSVs contain sensitive data it
# is highly recommended that a passworded ZIP file be created.  To create password ZIP files during backup, specify
# password below. If section/key below are deleted or left blank, ZIP file backup will have have no password.

# Each entry in this section represents a backup schedule.  Key names do not matter but the value is
# a comma-delimted string with these columns:
#     s3_folder_name, interval_between_backups, num_files_to_keep
# e.g. Entry "schedule1=daily,1d,7" says cycle files in S3 folder "daily", waiting at least "1d" (1 day) between
# backups, and retaining 7 files (after 7, the oldest file is deleted first to retain maximum of 7 files).
# Valid interval_between_backups values include <N>s, <N>h, <N>m, <N>w, <N>m; where <N> is positive integer and
# the character s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, w=weeks, M=months, Y=years.
